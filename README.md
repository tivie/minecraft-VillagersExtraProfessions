**Villager Extra Professions** is a compatibility resource pack designed to bridge the gap between the [More Villagers: Re-employed](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-villagers-re-employed) mod and the [Villagers [Male and Female]](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/villagers-male-and-female) resource pack.

The *Villagers [Male and Female]* resource pack replaces the default villager model with custom male and female models. However, the additional professions introduced by *More Villagers: Re-employed* are designed for the vanilla villager model and therefore do not display correctly when used together.

This resource pack solves that problem by **recreating and adapting the textures of the extra professions from *More Villagers: Re-employed*** so they correctly align with the villager models used by *Villagers [Male and Female]*. The result is full visual compatibility, allowing the new professions to render as intended without broken or misaligned textures.

## Credits & Attribution

This resource pack includes **adapted textures originally created for the mod [More Villagers: Re-employed](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-villagers-re-employed)**, authored by **[frikinjay](https://modrinth.com/user/frikinjay)**.

## Important Notes
- This is **not a standalone resource pack**.
- It **requires** the **Villagers [Male and Female]** resource pack to function.
- It also **requires** the **More Villagers: Re-employed** mod.
- If either dependency is missing, this resource pack will have no effect.

## Load Order
To ensure proper functionality, place **Villager Extra Professions** **right before** *Villagers [Male and Female]* in your resource pack list, since it requires the model from *Villagers [Male and Female]* to be loaded first.

## Scope
- No new professions are added.
- No gameplay changes are introduced.
- This pack only provides **visual compatibility** between the two projects.
